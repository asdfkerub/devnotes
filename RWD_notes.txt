FONT SIZES
----------
REM
(1rem = 16px) 16px is the default browser size
example:
  font-size: 2rem;

EM and/or %
(1em = 16px = 100%) 16px the default browser size
Both em and % are relative measures. The difference is what each is relative to. em is always relative to font size.
% is relative to the containing block, usually the body, a div, or a table unless applied to font-size, in which case it applies to the parent font-size.

CONCLUSION
em is becoming the standard for font sizes on the web, and we will be using ems instead of % when we deal with:

font sizes - Since we are more familiar with pixels, we will be doing calculations a lot to convert pixel to em. The formula is 1 / parent's font-size * required pixel value = em value. 
So if you are planning to have a 24px text and the parent's font-size is 1em or 16px, then:

1 / 16px * 24px = 1.5em
sizing images - For images, we are only interested in width, because we will just use auto for the height. Making it adjust proportionately to whatever width the image has. So if we want an image with 20px as width, then:

1 / 16px * 20px = 1.25em
paddings / margins (for fonts)
We use % when we deal with:

column's / container's width - If you plan to have a 320px width on a 960px width container, then:

320 / 960 = 33.333% 
We use rem:

font sizes
paddings / margins (for fonts)
Finally, we use px for:

media queries
paddings / margins (for containers like divs)
