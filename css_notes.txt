•Block elements: <body> , <div> , <form> , <h1> - <h6> , <p> , <table> , <ul> , <ol> , <li>
•Inline elements: <a> , <img> , <span> , <input> , <label> , <select> , <textarea>
  * Invalid to put block elements inside of inline elements.

•If all elements inside a container(div) are floted,the container will collapse.
to solve this. add an overflow:hidden; and height:auto; to the container element that is containing
floated elements. OR add a dummy div inside the same container and add css to the dummy of clear:both;

•Font size, use EM. Ems responds to resizing well.
  - 12 pt = 16px = 1em = 100%
